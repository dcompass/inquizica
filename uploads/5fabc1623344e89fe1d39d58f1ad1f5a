Explanation,"The filtered load of sodium equals: (GFR x Plasma concentration of sodium) i.e., 180 L/day x 140 mEq/L = 20100 mEq/day.","On average, 65 to 80% of the filtered sodium load is reabsorbed along the proximal tubule.  For example, in this case the filtered sodium load equals 25,200 mEq/day, so the amount of sodium reabsorbed along the proximal tubule ranges is determined by multipling the filtered sodium load by the percent of sodium that is reabsorbed along this segment, i.e., (25,200 x 0.65) = 16,380 mEq/day to (25,200 x 0.80) = 20,160 mEq/day. ","On average, approxiamately 25% of the filtered sodium load is reabsorbed along the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle.  In this case, the filtered sodium load equals 25,200 mEq/day, so the amount of sodium reabsorbed equals: (25,200 x 0.25) = 6,300 mEq/day.  Furthermore, approximately 50% of the 6,300 mEq/day is reabsorbed transcellularly via the NKCC2 cotransporters and NHE3 exchanger, while the other 50% is reabsorbed via passive paracellular processess.   ","On average, approximately 5% of the sodium filtered load is reabsorbed along the distal tubule, conncecting segment, and cortical collecting duct, combined.  In this case, the filtered sodium load equals 25,200 mEq/day, so the amount of sodium reabsorbed equals: (25,200 x 0.05) = 1,260 mEq/day.  Reabsorption of sodium along the distal tubule occurs by active transport processess, while transport along the connecting segment and cortical collecting duct occurs via passive transcellular processess.   ","On average, approximately 3% of the sodium filtered load is reabsorbed along the medullary collecting duct.  In this case, the filtered sodium load equals 25,200 mEq/day, so the amount of sodium reabsorbed equals: (25,200 x 0.03) = 756 mEq/day.  Reabsorption of sodium along the medullary collecting duct occurs via passive transcellular processess, i.e., epithelial sodium channels (ENaC).   ","Aldosterone, a steroid hormone synthesized and released by cells in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal gland, increases sodium reabsorption along the collecting duct (mostly the cortical collecting duct) by increasing the number and activity of epithelial sodium channels (ENaC).
